# railway

TypeScript SDK for Railway. Create sandboxes and run commands in them, and define your
project's infrastructure as code.

**The SDK is in beta and there will be breaking changes**. The version of this SDK started on v3.0.0.

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/railway.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/railway)
[![license](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/railway.svg)](./LICENSE)
[![CI](https://github.com/railwayapp/railway-ts-sdk/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/railwayapp/railway-ts-sdk/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Quick start

Scaffold a new project with the SDK preconfigured:

```bash
bun create railway@latest
```

This generates a TypeScript project with starter code, a `.env.example` for your
credentials, and reference docs for AI coding assistants.

## Installation

To add the SDK to an existing project:

```bash
bun add railway
```

```ts
import { Sandbox } from "railway";

// reads RAILWAY_API_TOKEN + RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT_ID from the environment
const sandbox = await Sandbox.create();

const { stdout } = await sandbox.exec("echo hello");
console.log(stdout);

await sandbox.destroy();
```

Sandboxes come from static factory methods:

- `Sandbox.create(options?)`: provision a new sandbox.
- `Sandbox.create(template, options?)`: provision from a template (see [Templates](#templates)).
- `Sandbox.create(source, options?)`: fork a running sandbox (see [Forking](#forking)).
- `Sandbox.connect(id, options?)`: reattach to an existing sandbox by id.
- `Sandbox.list(options?)`: list sandboxes in the environment.

`create` resolves once the sandbox is `RUNNING`, so it is ready to `exec` against.

## Running commands

`exec` runs a command to completion and returns its result. It does not throw on a
non-zero exit code; inspect `exitCode` instead.

```ts
const result = await sandbox.exec("npm run build", { timeoutSec: 120 });

result.exitCode; // number | null; null if the session ended without one
result.stdout; // string
result.stderr; // string
result.truncated; // true if the server cut the output
result.timedOut; // true if the command hit timeoutSec (enforced client-side)
```

`cwd` and `env` apply per command (the SDK composes them into the command, so
they work on every sandbox):

```ts
const result = await sandbox.exec("pnpm test", {
  cwd: "/app",
  env: { CI: "true" },
});
```

Per-exec env values are embedded in the command string and visible to `ps`
inside the sandbox; bake secrets in at create time via `Sandbox.create({ env })`
instead. Both options apply to fresh execs only — reattaching by `sessionName`
rejects them.

Every exec runs over a WebSocket bridge to the sandbox, with separated
stdout/stderr and a real exit code. Short commands resolve when they exit;
passing `onStdout`/`onStderr` streams output live from the first byte. The
handle also exposes the `sessionName` and a `kill()`:

```ts
const handle = sandbox.exec("npm run test:slow", {
  onStdout: chunk => process.stdout.write(chunk),
});

const sessionName = await handle.sessionName; // save to reattach later
await handle.kill(); // terminate it — SIGTERM by default (pass "KILL" to force)
const result = await handle; // same ExecResult shape as above
```

When durable sessions are enabled for the sandbox, reattach to a running exec
from anywhere — even another process — with the saved name. By default it
replays the retained log, then continues live (pass `resumeFromLastRead: true`
to resume from the last-read cursor instead):

```ts
const result = await sandbox.exec({ sessionName }, {
  onStdout: chunk => process.stdout.write(chunk),
});
```

See `examples/sandboxes/exec.ts` for detaching and reattaching by `sessionName`
from a fresh `Sandbox.connect(id)`.

If the WebSocket cannot be established, `exec` rejects with
`RailwayConnectionError`. In non-Node runtimes without a global `WebSocket`,
pass an implementation via the `webSocketImpl` config option.

## Files

`sandbox.files` reads and writes files in the sandbox filesystem. Content streams in
both directions, so files larger than memory can be transferred.

```ts
await sandbox.files.write("/app/config.json", JSON.stringify(config));
const text = await sandbox.files.read("/app/config.json"); // string

const bytes = await sandbox.files.read("/data/model.bin", { format: "bytes" }); // Uint8Array
await sandbox.files.write("/app/run.sh", "#!/bin/sh\n...", { mode: 0o755 });
```

`write` accepts a `string`, `Uint8Array`, `ArrayBuffer`, `Blob`, `ReadableStream`, any
`AsyncIterable<Uint8Array>`, or a function returning a stream or iterable. It creates
missing parent directories automatically. Strings, bytes, blobs, and function sources are
retried automatically if the connection drops mid-transfer. A bare stream is one-shot: a
drop mid-stream surfaces `RailwayConnectionError` and may leave a partial file. Streams upload
without buffering, so a large file can be pushed from disk; prefer the function form so
a retry can read a fresh stream:

```ts
import { createReadStream } from "node:fs";

await sandbox.files.write("/data/dataset.bin", () => createReadStream("./dataset.bin"));
```

Pull large files as a stream (cancelling the stream aborts the transfer), or read a
range: `offset`/`length` from the start, or `fromEnd` with `length` for tails:

```ts
const stream = await sandbox.files.read("/data/out.bin", { format: "stream" });
for await (const chunk of stream) process.stdout.write(chunk);

const tail = await sandbox.files.read("/var/log/app.log", { length: 4096, fromEnd: true });
```

Inspect and manage entries with `list`, `stat`, `exists`, `mkdir` (recursive, like
`mkdir -p`), `rename`, and `remove`. `remove` deletes files and empty directories; use
`sandbox.exec("rm -rf ...")` for recursive deletes:

```ts
for (const entry of await sandbox.files.list("/app")) {
  console.log(entry.name, entry.size, entry.isDir, entry.modTime);
}
```

Paths are absolute within the sandbox. Files are created `0644`; pass `mode` on `write`
to set permissions. Reads of missing paths throw
`SandboxFileNotFoundError`; other remote failures throw `SandboxFilesError` with the VM's
error text. Each operation authorizes itself with a short-lived files-scoped token, so
`files` works on any `RUNNING` sandbox you can `connect` to. See
`examples/sandboxes/files.ts` for a complete example.

## Forking

Fork a running sandbox to get an independent copy of its filesystem — handy for branching
an environment after expensive setup. A fork is a fresh boot from a clone of the source's
disk (not its live processes), created in the same environment.

```ts
const base = await Sandbox.create();
await base.exec("npm install");

const fork = await base.fork();
await fork.exec("npm test"); // sees the installed deps, isolated from base
```

`Sandbox.create(source)` is the same operation in static form. Pass `idleTimeoutMinutes` to
override the fork's idle timeout. The source must be `RUNNING`.

## Network isolation

By default a sandbox is `ISOLATED`: it has public NAT egress but cannot reach the rest of
your environment's private network. Pass `networkIsolation: "PRIVATE"` to place it on the
environment private network, so it can talk to your other services.

```ts
const sandbox = await Sandbox.create({ networkIsolation: "PRIVATE" });
sandbox.networkIsolation; // "ISOLATED" | "PRIVATE"
```

`networkIsolation` is settable on `create`, `create(template)`, and `fork`, and is read
back on every sandbox. It defaults to `ISOLATED` when omitted.

## Reconnecting and listing

A sandbox outlives the process that created it, so you can reattach to it by id.

```ts
const sandbox = await Sandbox.connect("sbx_abc123");
await sandbox.exec("cat /tmp/state.json");

const all = await Sandbox.list();
```

`connect` throws `SandboxNotFoundError` if the sandbox does not exist in the
environment. `sandbox.refresh()` re-reads the sandbox to update `status` and the other
fields in place. `status` is one of `CREATING`, `RUNNING`, `DESTROYING`, `DESTROYED`,
`FAILED`.

## Automatic cleanup

A sandbox is a disposable resource. With `await using` it is destroyed when the scope
exits, even on throw.

```ts
await using sandbox = await Sandbox.create();
await sandbox.exec("pytest");
// destroyed automatically on scope exit
```

`sandbox.destroy()` is always available for explicit teardown.

## Templates

A template is a reusable base: an ordered list of build steps (system packages, env,
a working directory, raw commands) that Railway builds once, content-addresses, and
caches. Creating a sandbox from a template forks that cached build instead of starting
from scratch.

```ts
import { Sandbox } from "railway";

const base = Sandbox.template()
  .withPackages("ffmpeg")
  .workdir("/app");

const sandbox = await Sandbox.create(base);
await sandbox.exec("ffmpeg -version");
```

A `SandboxTemplate` is immutable: every method returns a new template. It is sent to
Railway only when you build it or create a sandbox from it.

- `.run(command)`: a raw build step.
- `.withPackages(...names)`: install Debian packages.
- `.withEnv({ KEY: "value" })`: set environment variables for later steps.
- `.workdir(dir)`: set the working directory for later steps.
- `.build(options?)`: build the template ahead of time, so later `create` calls can
  fork from the cached build. `Sandbox.create(template)` builds for you, so this is
  only needed to pre-warm.

Create a template with `Sandbox.template()`. Building throws `SandboxTemplateBuildError`
on failure and `SandboxTimeoutError` if it exceeds the 5-minute timeout.

## Infrastructure as Code

> **Experimental.** The IaC API is in beta and will change.

Describe a Railway project — services, databases, buckets, variables, domains, replicas,
and canvas groups — in TypeScript, and let the Railway CLI plan and apply the difference
against your environment. Authoring lives in a separate entrypoint, `railway/iac`:

```ts
// .railway/railway.ts
import { defineRailway, github, postgres, project, service } from "railway/iac";

export default defineRailway(() => {
  const db = postgres("db");

  const web = service("web", {
    source: github("acme/web"),
    build: "pnpm build",
    start: "pnpm start",
    healthcheck: "/health",
    env: {
      NODE_ENV: "production",
      DATABASE_URL: db.env.DATABASE_URL, // typed cross-service reference
    },
  });

  return project("my-app", { resources: [db, web] });
});
```

Then, from the directory linked to your Railway project:

```bash
railway config plan    # preview the diff against the linked environment
railway config apply   # apply it — prompts before destructive changes
```

How it works:

- **Declarative and stateless.** Your `.railway/railway.ts` is diffed against the *live*
  environment — there is no state file to manage or drift from.
- **Plan, then apply.** `plan` previews; `apply` prompts interactively (`--yes` to skip).
  Removing resources or variables is destructive and additionally requires
  `--confirm-destructive` in non-interactive or agent sessions, so a stray `--yes` can't
  silently delete infrastructure.
- **Safe by construction.** An `apply` is rejected if the environment changed since the
  plan it was computed against, and variable values are redacted from plan output so
  secrets don't leak into terminals or CI logs.

The DSL in brief:

- Resources: `service`, `fn` (cron), `postgres` / `mysql` / `redis` / `mongo`, `bucket`,
  `group`.
- Sources: `github(repo)`, `image(ref)`, `template(name)`, `empty()`.
- Variables: literals, typed references to another resource (`db.env.DATABASE_URL`),
  shared variables (`ctx.shared.NAME`), and `preserve()` to keep a value Railway already
  holds.
- Per-environment logic via the context: `ctx.isEnvironment("production")`,
  `ctx.environment`.

Beta limitations to know:

- Services managed by `railway.json` / `railway.toml` must be migrated before IaC can
  manage them.
- Bucket regions are immutable after creation.

## Configuration

`token`, `environmentId`, and `endpoint` each resolve in order: an explicit option,
then an environment variable, then a default. Pass explicit values to override.

| Option | Environment variable | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `token` | `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN` | _(required)_ |
| `environmentId` | `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT_ID` | _(required)_ |
| `endpoint` | `RAILWAY_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT` | `https://backboard.railway.com/graphql/v2` |
| `fetch` | n/a | `globalThis.fetch` |
| `verbose` | `RAILWAY_VERBOSE` | `false` |

```ts
const sandbox = await Sandbox.create({
  token: process.env.MY_TOKEN,
  environmentId: process.env.MY_ENV_ID,
  endpoint: "https://backboard.railway.com/graphql/v2",
  idleTimeoutMinutes: 30,
});
```

Environment variables are read only where a runtime exposes them, so the SDK is safe to
import in the browser and edge runtimes; provide credentials explicitly there.

### Verbose logging

Set `verbose: true` (or `RAILWAY_VERBOSE=1`) to print human-readable progress to **stderr** —
GraphQL requests, readiness polling, and lifecycle events. Useful when a `create`, `fork`, or
template build seems stuck. Tokens and `env` values are never logged.

## Errors

All errors extend `RailwayError`:

- `RailwayAuthError`: a required credential (`token` / `environmentId`) could not be
  resolved. Names the missing variable on `.variable`.
- `RailwayGraphQLError`: the Railway API returned an error. Carries `.status`,
  `.errors`, and `.responseBody`.
- `StaleEnvironmentError`: an IaC `apply` was rejected because the environment changed
  since the plan was computed. Re-run `plan` and review before applying again.
- `SandboxNotFoundError`: `connect` or `refresh` could not find the sandbox. Carries
  `.id` and `.environmentId`.
- `SandboxFailedError`: a sandbox reached a terminal state (`FAILED`, `DESTROYING`,
  or `DESTROYED`) before becoming `RUNNING` during `create`. Carries `.id` and
  `.status`.
- `SandboxTemplateBuildError`: a template build finished `FAILED`. Carries
  `.templateId` and `.environmentId`.
- `SandboxTimeoutError`: a readiness wait (template → `READY` or sandbox → `RUNNING`)
  exceeded the 5-minute timeout. Carries `.resource`, `.id`, `.lastStatus`, and
  `.timeoutMs`.
- `SandboxFilesError`: a file operation was rejected by the sandbox (permission denied,
  not a directory, disk full, ...). Carries `.operation` and `.path`.
- `SandboxFileNotFoundError`: the path does not exist; subclass of `SandboxFilesError`.

## Requirements

Node.js 22+ (for `await using`). Works in any runtime with a global `fetch`; pass a
`fetch` implementation explicitly where there is none.
